Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

Description:
This project implements a real-time data stream anomaly detection tool using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and dynamic thresholds.

Requirements:

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, random

Setup:

	1.	Install required libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

	1.	Run the main script to initiate real-time detection and visualization:
    python main.py

Additional Notes:
The program is modular, with individual scripts handling data generation, anomaly detection, and visualization.
